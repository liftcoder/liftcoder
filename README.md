### Hello, world!

I'm Higor, a passionate avgeek individual with the head in the clouds and fingers on the keyboard.

⌨ I'm currently exploring the world of software development, starting with HTML, CSS and JavaScrypt. Since I love to explore every detail in airplanes, why not learn how to manipulate and to code the machines that help develop my passion. Right?

I have some ideas for tools that will add at least a little bit of help to the Right know, my goal is to build the necessary skills to make my ideas reality.
